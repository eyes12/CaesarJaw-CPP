# CaesarJaw-CPP 🗝️

CaesarJaw is a powerful encryption and decryption tool written in C++ that utilizes a simple shift cipher, also known as the Caesar cipher. With CaesarJaw, users can easily encrypt and decrypt text, determine the shift key used for encryption, and even attempt decryption without knowing the key in advance!
